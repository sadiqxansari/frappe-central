"""Subscription intent + the two-axis state model (issue #04).

A Central Subscription is the customer's *intent/contract*. Agentless (ADR 0006):
Central provisions via the cluster manager and writes the authoritative runtime
record (the price-lock) itself, at provision time — see `provision_subscription`.
State lives on two orthogonal axes, never one enum:

  - operational (running / stopped / terminated) — Central's record of cluster-
    manager state (read from / reported by the cluster manager)
  - account standing (current / past_due / suspended) — owned by Central, here

Central never collapses the axes: a resource can be `running` and `past_due` at
once (normal grace), so one enum would lose information. Every standing transition
writes an append-only Subscription Change.
