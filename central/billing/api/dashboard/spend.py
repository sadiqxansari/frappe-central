"""What the team is paying for this cycle.

Derived from the same places billing itself reads — the projection engine for
money, the `Subscription Change` ledger for what is running (ADR 0010) — so a
customer never sees a number the monthly run would disagree with.

`list_rate_for` lives here too: it answers "what would this cost at today's
prices", which the resize disclosure needs to say what a resize gives up.
