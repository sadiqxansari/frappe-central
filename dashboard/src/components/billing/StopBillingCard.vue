// Suspend all servers — the team's kill switch for spend. Named for what it

// when the actual effect is every server powering down. A bare section, not a
// card: it's a quiet footer verb under the card stack, not a data surface.
//
// GROUNDING GAP (#69): there is no backend endpoint for this yet. The control is
// rendered disabled until one lands (e.g. a suspend-all action gated on
// billing:manage). Wiring it up is intentionally deferred — see the issue note.
