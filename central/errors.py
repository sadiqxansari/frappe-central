"""User-facing error envelopes for server-flow actions.

A failed action must tell the user what happened and what to do about it — never a
FrappeException or a raw traceback. Every server-action failure is shaped into a small
envelope ({code, title, message, remediation, retriable}) built from `ERROR_CATALOG`,
and carried to the client on the message it raises (Frappe serializes each message-log
entry, extra keys included, into `_server_messages`). The stable `code` is what the UI
switches on; `message`/`remediation` are the words a person reads (see the Wix "write
better error messages" guidance: plain language, cause, reassurance, next step).

Wire this at the two ends of the Server flow: `throw_action_error` where Central raises a
known failure, and the `@resource_action` decorator on the whitelisted endpoints so nothing
— not even an unexpected bug — reaches the user as a bare exception.
