"""Who gets cut off, and when.

The cheap half of the cohort question, and the operationally urgent one. Answering it
needs **no rating at all**: every input is already a fact — invoices that are Open or
Overdue, their real `dunning_starts_on`, and the live ladder. It is `dunning_schedule`
applied to rows that exist.

That makes its cost scale with **delinquency rather than with the book**. Most teams
pay, so the unpaid set stays a few thousand rows at any size of business, and this can
run over everything, on demand, indefinitely. Cohort *revenue* projection has to be
filter-bounded precisely because it cannot make that claim.

Nothing here is estimated and nothing is assumed. Every column is a stored fact or
arithmetic over one.
