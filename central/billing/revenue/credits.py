"""Credit ledger — the customer's prepaid wallet (issue #06).

Every credit movement is an append-only Credit Ledger Entry (the audit trail).
Bookings serialise on a Credit Wallet anchor row via `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`: a
concurrent booking for the same wallet blocks on that single primary-key row
until the prior transaction commits — closing the concurrent double-spend race.

The wallet is keyed **(team, currency)**, one anchor per currency a team holds
([ADR 0018](../../../../docs/adr/0018-invariants-are-enforced-not-observed.md)).
It was once keyed by team alone, with a single currency-blind `balance`: the
invoice waterfall read a *per-currency* balance off the ledger but debited the
*currency-blind* anchor, so a team holding two currencies could be driven
negative in one of them while the anchor stayed positive. The composite key makes
"the balance is never negative" true **per currency**, and the `CHECK (balance >=
0)` constraint on the column makes it true against every caller, not only the
polite ones.

Promotional credit expires; purchased credit does not. The wallet still holds one
balance, so "which credit is this?" is answered by replaying the ledger rather than
by a second column — see the expiry section at the foot of this module.

The balance is read and written ON the locked anchor row, not via a `FOR UPDATE`
on the ledger. An earlier version read the latest balance with
`... ORDER BY creation DESC LIMIT 1 FOR UPDATE`, which took a next-key lock on
the HEAD of the global `creation` index — the gap every team's INSERT lands in —
so bookings for *different* teams deadlocked there despite each holding only its
own wallet lock. Locking a single PK row takes no gap locks, so bookings for
different wallets never contend. The anchor's `balance` stays in lockstep with
the newest ledger entry's `running_balance` **for that currency**; the ledger
remains the audit truth.
