// Pay an outstanding (Open) invoice — postpaid one-off settlement.
// Ported from the legacy dashboard.
//
// Webhook-truth: pay_invoice never returns Paid. It starts (or finds) a single
// in-flight Payment Attempt and returns {charged, reason?, attempt?}. We show an
// "initiated" toast and let the caller refetch; the invoice flips to Paid only
// when the gateway webhook lands. So this composable never asserts success — it
// asserts "we kicked off a charge".
