"""The team's own billing record, across periods rather than within one.

Everything on the Overview is scoped to the current cycle, and its trays explain
that cycle. What genuinely does not fit there is history: twelve months of spend,
where it went by product and region, every payment and refund across invoices, and
a statement an accountant can read. That is what this module serves.

The family/region grouping reuses the revenue reports' own helpers rather than
re-deriving them, so a customer's "cost per product" and the operator's services
revenue cannot disagree about what a line belongs to.

One thing deliberately absent: a downloadable tax invoice. ERPNext is the invoice
authority (ADR 0019) and the sync is strictly outbound, so the statutory document
is not ours to hand over yet. `get_tax_summary` reports what Central itself rated,
which is a working paper, not a filing.
