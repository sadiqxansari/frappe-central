"""Rung 4 of the enforcement ladder — the invariants no constraint can hold (ADR 0018).

An invariant belongs here ONLY if it cannot be pushed lower. `balance >= 0` is a
`CHECK` constraint (rung 1) and has no business being audited. But
`wallet.balance == Σ(ledger)` spans two tables, and no `CHECK` can see both — so it is
audited, and audit is the *weakest* rung: it detects, it does not prevent.

Every check answers one question with a second, independent derivation of a number the
system already believes. Where the two disagree, money has drifted. That is a defect
with a team and an amount attached, not a metric.

`observability.md` §6 asked for these as counters. A counter has no teeth, which is
why it was specified and never built. These return violations — rows a human reads,
surfaced by the **Billing Invariant Violations** report and a daily job that only
speaks up when something is wrong.

**Adding a check:** write a function returning `list[Violation]`, register it in
`CHECKS`. Aggregate in SQL; never loop a query per row — this runs over the whole
ledger.

	This is an **inequality, and deliberately so.** Equality is not assertable today,
	because `amount_paid` has no defined meaning after a refund. Both of these are real,
	from live data:

	  - a fully-refunded invoice stays `Paid` with `amount_paid` intact (a dispute
	    refunds to source; the invoice is not un-billed) — so subtracting refunds from
	    the captured sum would flag a perfectly healthy invoice;
	  - a charge → refund → re-charge history has TWO money-taking attempts for one
	    invoice — so requiring the sum to *equal* `amount_paid` would flag that one.

	Any equality would therefore cry wolf on real histories, and a check that cries wolf
	is worse than no check (see `observability.md` §6, which specified equalities and was
	never built). What IS sound: we cannot have paid out more than the gateway ever took
	in. That catches the defect worth catching — an invoice marked `Paid` with nothing
	behind it — and stays silent on legitimate refund histories.

	Pinning `amount_paid`'s post-refund semantics is an open design question; when it is
	settled this check can be tightened to an equality.

	Scoped to the retention window because `cleanup_payment_logs` prunes terminal
	attempts after ~90 days — outside it there is nothing left to reconcile against.
