"""Free/trial as the entry trust tier (issue #16).

Free/trial is not a separate code path: provisioning, the event log, metering,
the price-lock and the line-item math all run identically to a paying team.
Central branches at exactly one point — at invoice generation an entry-tier
team's invoice is emitted as `cost_report` (computed, never charged), so the
free/trial subsidy is a *true* cost.

Conversion flips the tier (cost_report -> billable) with resources untouched;
expiry reuses the suspend directive on the entitlement-token channel.
