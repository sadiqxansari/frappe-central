"""The time-weighted line-item engine — fixed charges from Subscription Change
rate-snapshot segments. Shared by draft generation and the dashboard forecast.

Billing is daily by default: a stable config (one held for 24h or more) bills a
whole day at a time, so a normal month reads as a handful of clean day lines and
a full day always costs one day's rate — the "daily cap".

Hourly billing kicks in only when a machine *churns*: two config changes less
than 24h apart (a resize twice in a day, or a peak-then-drop even across
midnight). Any calendar date a churn segment touches is billed by the exact hours
each config ran that date, which closes the sub-day gaming loophole and bills a
short-lived config fairly. Because a date is billed either daily OR hourly — never
both — the two passes partition the period and the total stays exact.
